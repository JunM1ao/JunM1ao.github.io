As of 2020-6-18, the project is still ongoing.

Mango is a discord bot mainly built for moderation purposes. The bot is not server dependent (using MongoDB to store settings), so this can work on any server and multiple servers. However, the first time setup might take some time as settings can only be changed through discord alone.

Some notable features:
* Basic moderation commands such as prune, kick, ban...
* Converting server updates the bot receives and sends it into the desired channel as embeds
* Scans message / name update received from a member through given word list for inappropriate words
* Role menu base on user reaction
* Anti raid
* Mute / Warn system
* Reminder system
* Automatic join role system

Through programming Mango Pi, I was able to put all the skills I've learned like recursion, classes, inheritance into practical use and train me how to debug a program. On top of that, I was able to get a good understanding on Python and MongoDB.
