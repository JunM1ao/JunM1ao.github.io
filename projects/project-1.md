This project is made with the knowledge of basic programming knowledge such as if statements, loops, and basic datatypes. Project 1 is made with no prior knowledge of classes and methods, so this could serve as a great example of what code would look like without classes or methods (messy).

The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/JunM1ao/ICS-111-Project-1).
