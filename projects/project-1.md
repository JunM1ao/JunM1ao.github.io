summary: First ICS 111 Project made with EZJava.
---
This project made with the knowledge of basic programming knowledge such as if statements, loops, and basic data types. Project 1 is made with no prior knowledge of classes and methods, so this could serve as a great example of what code would look like without classes or methods (messy).

Even with the messy code, this project is able to help me gain a solid understanding of loops, if-statements, and operators in programming languages.
