#### [Club Lounge Project Page](https://club-lounge.github.io/)
For this project, I am mainly responsible for the "club role" system. This system meant to allow specified club member to have to power to edit club page and create events for that club, of course the club owner would have all the permission available to them(managing club member roles). I also help resolve any potential errors or bugs that occurs during the development and help to resolve merge conflicts.
