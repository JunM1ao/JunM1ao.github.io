Originally, I plan to enroll in Media major to do video editing. Back in high school, I was part of the media team and was quite interested in video editing. However, my parents refused, stating that being a video editor is not a good career path. They wanted me to do accounting as it offers more opportunities, but I hesitated because I have no interest in that field. Near the end of high school, it came to me that there is something else that I always had an interest in Computers. After convincing my parents,  I enrolled in the University of Hawaii at Manoa as a computer science major. On enrollment, I have little to no knowledge of coding, evident by my first ICS project of a dodgeball game. Bit by bit, I start to grasp the basics and improve.

Now with at least some experience in coding, one field that piqued my interest is the mobile platform, especially from the Android side. Android's open-source nature has allowed people to customize Android to their liking, and if they are lucky, they won't be affected by manufacture discontinuing support if third party support is available. I remember being able to push my old Samsung Galaxy S2 to Android Nougat. With smartphones becoming more accessible, mobile development seems like a great field to try to thrive in.

Another field I am interested in database management. With more and more things stored in the cloud, demand for the skill to manage a database will only ever increase. In my own spare time, I've made a Discord bot that relies on storing information on a database. I can speak from experience that database management isn't only for the big server room, but also for some app development as well.
