Technologies make people's life easier. Instead of searching through library books to find the information you need, "Google it." Instead of doing all your math calculations manually repeatedly, let a machine handle the data processing.

Of course, nothing is smooth sailing. [The Facebook controversy](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/live/2018/apr/10/mark-zuckerberg-testimony-live-congress-facebook-cambridge-analytica), that prompt many to worry about their digital data. [A support ticket for a limited edition bag that ended up doxing you instead](https://kotaku.com/bethesda-support-leaks-fallout-76-customer-names-addre-1830892930). Events like these have led some to question whether or not we need a safeguard to be in place to protect consumers.

## Ethics of Programming

Whether it be a person that wants to find any potential loopholes within a system and patch it for better security or use it for their gain, ethics differs from person to person. [Typically](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics), being a programmer require one to:
* Perform task to the best of their ability and produce quality products
* Act in the best interest of their client, employer, and the general public
* Be fair and supportive to their peers
* Ability to make appropriate and professional judgement (EX: express when something can't be done)

## Case Study on Facebook

Back in 2018, Facebook came under heavy fire for allowing Cambridge Analytica to use it's user data to run targetted ads for Trump's presidential campaign. When the news broke out, people were furious. Furious that Facebook would let an unauthorized third party use their user data for political advertisement. This happened when public trust for Facebook is already at it's lowest, and this scandal only added more fuel to the fire, resulting in Facebook's stock prices to tank. While Facebook may not have foreseen the API abuse by Cambridge Analytica. Facebook, however, still shoulders the responsibility of failing to build a secure system for its users. Facebook later implemented more strict access to their API and disallowed developer to access user friend data, damage to their reputation have been done. Even today, some still question whether or not Facebook respects user privacy.
After the scandal, companies that would use AI for targetted advertisements now includes how user data would be handled in their terms of service. Some even include an option to either op-out or limit the amount of data the company could collect on them. Perhaps, transparency from Facebook from the very start would have saved it from the whole ordeal.

I believe in the term "Better to be safe than sorry." Facebook, a company that takes care of private data of billions of users, should be as transparent as possible and follow good ethics to avoid this catastrophe. While I, a person who doesn't use social media that much, was slightly shocked by the whole scandal back in 2018 but not too worried. If there is a message to take home for people who frequent social media: pretend the social media app you have as a stranger, how much are you willing to share with someone you just met?
