Many people have encountered similar situations like that. You are just casually browsing the web and then an unskippable ad appears right before you. Now you have to sit there and watch the timer tick down to 0 before you can regain site control. No one likes to visit a site bloated with ads. However, ads are there to keep the website running and free for the public. But then, there are also those sneaky ads that dress themselves to be the next page button. When you click on it:

This is partially why some people detest JavaScript. But one should not forget that JavaScript also allowed the birth of many beautiful modern web UIs and in fact vital for some websites.

I too avoided JavaScript like a plague but ICS 314 finally gave me the push to try it out. It felt similar yet strange at the same time. Like Python, JavaScript doesn't require you speicify variable before assignment or specifying the return type for a function or a method unlike Java, and C/C++.

#### Python:
```python
def myFunction():
	return 10
	
ret = myFunction()
print(ret) # 10
```
#### JavaScript:
```js
function myFunction() {
	return 10;
}
```

But unlike the languages I know, JavaScript gives you the ability to return a function and assign it to a variable.
```js
function multiply(input) {
	return function(second) {
		return input * second;
	}
}

const ret = multiply(2);
console.log(ret(3)); // 6
```

From my short time interacting with JavaScript, it definitely feels like a a powerful tool for those trying to do web design and don't want to be limited by HTML and CSS. With the rise in demand for JavaScript, it's here to stay for a quite some time.

If you want to get into JavaScript, [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) offers a great introductory lesson, and maybe try to work through some timed examples from [WODs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) to help you get more familiar with the language.
