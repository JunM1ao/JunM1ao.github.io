Many people have encountered similar situations like that. You are just casually browsing the web and then an unskippable ad appears right before you. Now you have to sit there and watch the timer tick down to 0 before you can regain site control. No one likes to visit a site bloated with ads. However, ads are there to keep the website running and free for the public. But then, there are also those sneaky ads that dress themselves to be the next page button. When you click on it: 
>"Critical alert from Microsoft."
<img class = "ui big floated image" src = "/images/scam.png">
This is partially why many people detest JavaScript. But one should not forget that JavaScript also allowed the birth of many beautiful modern web UIs and in fact vital for some websites.

I too avoided JavaScript like a plague but ICS 314 finally gave me the push to try it out, and it's kind of similar to Python. Like Python, JavaScript doesn't require you to specify the return type for a function or a method unlike Java, and C/C++.
```python
def myFunction():
	return 10
```

```js
function myFunction() {
	return 10;
}
```

Another interesting thing JavaScript can do is return a function and assign it to a variable.
```js
function multiply(input) {
	return function(second) {
		return input * second;
	}
}

const ret = multiply(2);
console.log(ret(3)); // 6
```

To say JavaScript is terrible language might be a bit far from the truth, as many websites use it. Like many programming languages, there is a purpose for it to stay relevant to today. JavaScript is your goto for web design, however, don't try to make the next triple-A game with it. For those trying to get into JavaScript, [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) offers a great introduction, and try to work through some examples within a given time like [WODs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) would help strengthen your understanding.
